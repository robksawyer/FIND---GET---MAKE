## CakePHP Problems Plugin

This plugin allows to attach problem reports to any model record on your app. Problem reports
consist of a configurable type and a problem description or cause and can be submitted by logged in users
only once per model record.

Problem reports can be listed and managed in the admin section. The admin_index action will list a summary of
all problem reports by model type and record. Such reports can be accepted and unaccepted by the administrator.
The acceptance of reports could trigger actions configurable in this plugin.

## Installation

1. Place the problems folder into any of your plugin directories for your app (for example app/plugins or cake/plugins)
2. Create database tables using either the schema shell or the migrations plugin:
		cake schema create -plugin problems -name problems
		cake migration run all -plugin problems
3. Attach the Reportable behavior to your models via the $actsAs variable or dynamically using the BehaviorsCollection object methods:
		public $actsAs = array('Problems.Reportable' => array('userClass' => 'User'))
	or
		$this->Behaviors->attach('Problems.Reportable', array('userClass' => 'User'))
4. Register your model in the Configure storage. This can be done in bootstrap.php or loading custom config files using Configure::load()
		Configure::write('Problems.Models', array(
			'AModel' => 'AModel',
			'APluginModel' => 'MyPlugin.ApluginModel'
		));

## Usage

1. Add the Problems helper to you controller
		public $helpers = array('Problems.Problems');
2. Use the helper in your views to generate links to the problem report form
		<?php echo $this->Problem->link('ModelName', 'recordID', 'Link Title'); ?>

This link will redirect the user to a form where he can report the problem

## Configuration Options
The Reportable behavior has some configuration option to adapt to your app needs. The configuration array accepts the following keys

1. modelClass: Set this to the real Model class you are attaching the behavior to. For example if you are attaching the reportable behavior to
	the class Comment in plugin Comments, set this config option to "Comments.Comment". By default the property $name of the model is used
2. userClass: The cake class name to use as the User model associated to the Problem report. By default it is "Users.User"
3. problemClass: If you need to extend the Problem model or override it with your own implementation set this key to the model you want to use
4. foreignKey: the field in your table that serves as reference for the primary key of the models it is attached to. (Used for own implementations of Problem model)
5. problemTypes: Set this variable to an array of problems types you want to use for your model. for example
		array(
			'stolen' => 'Stolen Material',
			'explicit_lyrics' => 'Explicit Lyrics'
		);

## Customization 

Additionally the behavior provides two callbacks to implement in your model:
1. afterReport: Implement this function in your model to take specific actions after a model record is reported
2. afterAcceptReport: Implement this function in your model to take specific actions after a problem report is marked as accepted for a model record, for example delete the entry in the database

The admin interface links to reported model records to ease the task of accepting the problems. This link is generated using the method "reportedObjectUrl". 
You can customize this links implementing this method in your model
		public function reportedObjectUrl($id) {
			return array('controller' => 'my_controller', 'action' => 'view', $id);
		}
